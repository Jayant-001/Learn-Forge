Project Idea 1: Personalized Learning Path Generator (Refined)
This remains a strong contender. Let&#39;s call it &quot;LearnForge&quot; for now. The core idea is to move beyond simple to-do lists and create a dynamic, structured learning environment for self-taught developers and professionals who are upskilling.
Problem: Learners feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources. They follow random tutorials without a clear path, leading to knowledge gaps and a lack of confidence. Tracking what you&#39;ve learned and what to review is manual and inefficient.
Detailed Problem Analysis:
Tutorial Hell: Many developers get stuck in a cycle of watching tutorials without ever building projects or solidifying fundamental concepts.
Lack of Structure: Unlike a university curriculum, self-learning is often haphazard. Knowing the logical order of topics (e.g., learning about the event loop before diving deep into async/await in Node.js) is crucial.
Knowledge Decay: Concepts learned but not applied or reviewed are quickly forgotten.
Connecting Theory to Practice: Learners struggle to find small, practical exercises to apply a newly learned concept immediately.
Requirements &amp; Use Cases:
Roadmap Templates: Users can select pre-built roadmaps for common goals (e.g., &quot;React Advanced,&quot; &quot;Go for Backend,&quot; &quot;System Design Fundamentals&quot;).
Custom Path Builder: Users can create their own learning paths by adding topics and sub-topics in a nested, visual structure (like a mind map).
Resource Aggregation: For each topic, users can link multiple resources: articles, YouTube videos, specific book chapters, their own notes.
Progress Tracking: Mark topics as &quot;To Learn,&quot; &quot;In Progress,&quot; or &quot;Completed.&quot; Visualize this on the roadmap.
Concept Flashcards &amp; Spaced Repetition: The key feature. For any topic, a user can create small flashcards of key concepts (e.g., &quot;What is a closure?&quot;). The system then schedules these for review using a spaced repetition system (SRS) to commit them to long-term memory.
&quot;Quick Practice&quot; Suggestions: For certain topics, the system could suggest small, practical coding challenges (these can be hard-coded initially, not AI-generated). E.g., for &quot;Array Methods in JS,&quot; a quick challenge could be &quot;Write a function to find the unique elements in an array.&quot;
Implementation Details:
Frontend: React (Next.js would be great for pre-rendering roadmaps for SEO). Use a library like react-flow for the visual path builder.
Backend: Go or Node.js. Go&#39;s strong typing would be beneficial for the structured data models.
Database: PostgreSQL. It&#39;s excellent for the relational nature of paths, topics, resources, and user progress.
Key Algorithm: The Spaced Repetition System (like SM-2) is a core backend logic component. You&#39;ll need to manage review schedules for each user&#39;s flashcards.
Complexity: Medium. The core CRUD operations are simple. The challenge and learning opportunity lie in building the visual path editor and the SRS logic.
This is the project idea given by you. I want you to analyze the required pages for this project. First analyze the projects its structure and needs accordingly plan the require pages and components and then design each page and component. I am using nextjs, tailwindcss and shadcn for your reference.

Build all the pages in /app and all the components. Use only tailwind css and you can use shadcn library for simplicity. Make in a way that later I can change theme of ui and add dark more etc. in fact you add dark mode feature as well in navber. . Leave the demo page and customnode because I was using that for learning purpose.

To add your workspace as context, enable local indexing in your IDE settings. After enabling, add @workspace to your question, and I'll generate a response using your workspace as context.

---

I'll analyze the LearnForge project structure and build all the required pages and components. Let me start by examining the current project structure and then create a comprehensive learning path generator application.

---

Now let me examine the current structure and create the LearnForge application. Based on the project analysis, I'll create the following structure:

**Pages needed:**
1. Dashboard (Home) - Overview of learning paths and progress
2. Roadmaps - Browse and select pre-built roadmaps
3. Path Builder - Create custom learning paths
4. Study - Active learning session with flashcards
5. Progress - Detailed progress tracking
6. Settings - User preferences and theme

**Components needed:**
1. Navigation with dark mode toggle
2. Roadmap cards and templates
3. Visual path builder
4. Flashcard system
5. Progress tracking components
6. Theme provider

Let me start by creating the theme provider and navigation:

---

You did really nice. Now let me give the main context of this website. Here on learning path I want to provide a &#39;Smart Learning Path Generator&#39; where user not follow an existing leraning path but can also create their own path based on their topics/choices. Where a learning path will be a graph that will be build by reactflow. where each node will show a topic to learn and its its subtopics will come under its child nodes or its adjacent node and so on. For reference you can see like https://roadmap.sh/ website where a learning path will show like a graph. But I will make some difference from roadmap.sh and that is I will give user the ability to customize/create or use any learning path. 
Each node will have bunch of functionalities: 
1. user can mark node as pending, in progress or complete. user can move nodes and attach to other nodes and so on (all react flow functionalities) when user will click on that node where will be multiple section like a description section while will contain bunch of text info like some description about that topics, imp links and other info. A notes section where user can write their nodes on that topic so user can revise/revisit the node for revision or quick note. there will be a ai chat section where user can ask some question about that topic. user can also delete the node or create multiple nodes linked by a node. user can also give a node time that will be required to complete that topic to tracking the progress like how many time user took to complete the node/topic. Later(not now) i will also integrate a feature where user can ask to create a learning plan or this path based on user&#39;s existing skills where user will ans some questions asked by ai and then ai will generate this path. 
So make everything extensible and decoupled. The nodes, edges, and all info will be store in database, backend side. user can also do changes in nodes like desc, time, and other things. Means things should be fully customizable. 

For this context build the things provided in instruction and you can also use your creativity power and add other relevant features. 

As of now store all data statically in file like json file or js file later will integrate backend. but frontend should be totally working prototype. ai chat and other things can be integrated lated by backend.
